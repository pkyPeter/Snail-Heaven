It's been a real journey in itself and joy to watch people come through the place and enjoy their stay. It's also taught us quite a lot about hospitality and the service of being a host. We really want to provide an experience that's memorable for all the right reasons, so if there are things you think we could do better please help us by letting us know.\r\n \r\nI (Tom) Travel a lot doing various bits of work with people in the field  of trauma relief and emotional processing. I'm really finding passion in doing that where it's most needed, in disaster zones, like the Philippines following Typhoon Yolanda, and Nepal following the big earthquake, Airbnb provides the stability in income that helps me pursue this, and for that I'm immeasurably grateful.\r\n\r\nThe co-hostess Kate, is an artist and native Taiwanese who paints, makes silver jewelry, teaches art workshops and does art projects that connect people and the living spaces. \r\n\r\nIt's been quite a blessing to be on Airbnb meeting all these wonderful people coming through and sharing what we can in the way of local knowledge, ins and outs of the neighborhoods, and giving the best service we can. \r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by here, we're glad you could make it!","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":"90%","host_acceptance_rate":"N/A","host_is_superhost":"t","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3dac6d92-365a-4210-8574-0b3b80a65fef.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3dac6d92-365a-4210-8574-0b3b80a65fef.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"","host_listings_count":"1","host_total_listings_count":"1","host_verifications":"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']","host_has_profile_pic":"t","host_identity_verified":"t","street":"Daan District, Taipei, Taiwan","neighbourhood":"Da'an","neighbourhood_cleansed":"大安區","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":"","city":"Daan District","state":"Taipei","zipcode":"106","market":"Taipei","smart_location":"Daan District, Taiwan","country_code":"TW","country":"Taiwan","latitude":"25.018453514343463","longitude":"121.53228905935957","is_location_exact":"f","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home/apt","accommodates":"4","bathrooms":"1.0","bedrooms":"1","beds":"2","bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":"{TV,\"Cable TV\",Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Hot tub\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",\"Suitable for events\",Washer,\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Stove,\"Single level home\",\"Patio or balcony\",\"Garden or backyard\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\",\"Host greets you\"}","square_feet":"","price":"$2,611.00","weekly_price":"$10,750.00","monthly_price":"$38,394.00","security_deposit":"","cleaning_fee":"","guests_included":"2","extra_people":"$307.00","minimum_nights":"2","maximum_nights":"1125","calendar_updated":"3 weeks ago","has_availability":"t","availability_30":"11","availability_60":"26","availability_90":"51","availability_365":"135","calendar_last_scraped":"2018-08-29","number_of_reviews":"196","first_review":"2012-11-23","last_review":"2018-08-14","review_scores_rating":"92","review_scores_accuracy":"9","review_scores_cleanliness":"9","review_scores_checkin":"10","review_scores_communication":"10","review_scores_location":"10","review_scores_value":"9","requires_license":"f","license":"","jurisdiction_names":"{\"Taiwan VAT Tax\"}","instant_bookable":"f","is_business_travel_ready":"f","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","require_guest_profile_picture":"t","require_guest_phone_verification":"f","calculated_host_listings_count":"1","reviews_per_month":"2.79"}

B. 房子的門口就有bus stop (步行30秒), 而bus 頻繁度為每2-3分鐘一班, bus除了通往捷運站, 也直接通往市中心(東區), 而且是門口下車. 而bus有通往的景點, 通常剛好也就是捷運站. Bus的資訊, 房子這都簡化整理好了. A & B 您可以比較一下, 不同狀況之下, 不見得A一定最方便. - 另外, Bus的軟椅子比捷運好坐, 而捷運通常要站著. - 再另外一點補充, 如果4個人買的捷運票, 差不多也可以搭一台出租車任何地方. 而且是門口到門口. 比方, 從房子這裡到台北101門口約$150台幣, 到市中心也約$150台幣. 如捷運一個人是$30台幣, $30 x 4 = $120台幣, 但有時需要換車, 走上走下的.  - 有的狀況捷運是方便的沒錯, 但有的時候捷運是用來避開塞車的. - 一般在台北玩了一整天之後, 即便房子就在捷運步行5分鐘的地方, 通常的遊客回房子休息時還是選擇搭出租車回去, 因為已經累了不想走上走下近站出站然後最後還要走5分鐘.

So when I am being a host, I take cleanliness very seriously, all the sheets/covers are changed every time a guest checks out, always. And we always send the old sheets/covers to laundry service. I would expect that when I travel using Airbnb, so I would do the same for my guests. \r\n\r\nI always welcome families with children. As I am also a mother, I understand what a family needs when travel with a baby or small children. I have extra baby tubs/ cots/ bath tubs/ baby chair I can lend you for freem just ask me about it. :)\r\n\r\nAbout myself:\r\nThanks for stopping by!  I love what I do. Creating nice space for travelers is my creative outlet – an opportunity to turn inward reflection into outward expression. \r\n\r\nI used to be a children's book illustrator, traveled much for my career. And I've had great experiences with Airbnb and made several friends along the way. In addition to art, I love wellbeing and nature which you will see by staying in my apartments.\r\n\r\nThrough this experience and work I do everyday, it liberates my passion for travel, I don't travel as much as I used to, but I love seeing people coming to my country, and I try to make every guest have a heart-warming space while in Taipei. Thank you to everyone who has wandered into this corner. To those I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, I invite you to join me on this journey with open arms.\r\n\r\nI like my guests to be comfortable and feel at home. I try to go above and beyond to make your stay as safe and comfortable as possible while giving you your privacy. I will gladly give you suggestions of things to do in Taipei and in the neighborhood.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"99%","host_acceptance_rate":"N/A","host_is_superhost":"f","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2668294/profile_pic/1440174346/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2668294/profile_pic/1440174346/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Da'an","host_listings_count":"14","host_total_listings_count":"14","host_verifications":"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']","host_has_profile_pic":"t","host_identity_verified":"t","street":"Daan District, Taiwan","neighbourhood":"Da'an","neighbourhood_cleansed":"大安區","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":"","city":"Daan District","state":"","zipcode":"106","market":"Taipei","smart_location":"Daan District, Taiwan","country_code":"TW","country":"Taiwan","latitude":"25.018923014461514","longitude":"121.5317341319976","is_location_exact":"f","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home/apt","accommodates":"6","bathrooms":"1.0","bedrooms":"2","beds":"3","bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":"{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Paid parking off premises\",Elevator,\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Lock on bedroom door\",\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Self check-in\",Lockbox,\"Private living room\",\"Baby bath\",\"High chair\",\"Babysitter recommendations\",\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Room-darkening shades\",\"Children’s dinnerware\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",\"Ethernet connection\",Microwave,\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Stove,\"Single level home\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\"}","square_feet":"","price":"$1,997.00","weekly_price":"$14,436.00","monthly_price":"$50,957.00","security_deposit":"$3,072.00","cleaning_fee":"$860.00","guests_included":"1","extra_people":"$307.00","minimum_nights":"2","maximum_nights":"35","calendar_updated":"2 weeks ago","has_availability":"t","availability_30":"7","availability_60":"26","availability_90":"34","availability_365":"294","calendar_last_scraped":"2018-08-29","number_of_reviews":"158","first_review":"2013-10-13","last_review":"2018-08-13","review_scores_rating":"91","review_scores_accuracy":"9","review_scores_cleanliness":"9","review_scores_checkin":"10","review_scores_communication":"9","review_scores_location":"9","review_scores_value":"9","requires_license":"f","license":"","jurisdiction_names":"{\"Taiwan VAT Tax\"}","instant_bookable":"t","is_business_travel_ready":"f","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","require_guest_profile_picture":"f","require_guest_phone_verification":"f","calculated_host_listings_count":"14","reviews_per_month":"2.66"}
